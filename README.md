# pi-window
Use a Raspberry Pi and a cheap/old screen to make a fake window for your depressing windowless office!


## System Requirements

I'm setting this up to run on a Raspberry Pi connected to an old flatscreen TV. I suppose it should work on just about any computer without too much trouble. Here's the specifics of my setup:

- Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.1
- Raspberry Pi OS  - Raspbian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)


## Required Software

You'll need to have the following packages installed in order for this to work. And remember, when in doubt it rarely hurts to do a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

- VLC (which comes installed by default in the Raspbian image)
